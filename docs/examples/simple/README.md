## Simple Example

This example will provide some of the basic features in AutomationObject without
cluttering you with too much code.

### Installation and Execution

1. cd into this directory
2. Run command 'bundle install' to install the gems needed
3. Run command 'ruby run.rb' to run the script already made to interact with the UI
4. Press enter to quit

### play.rb usage

This file will allow you to execute commands in the console and test out the framework.  Console will ask which command
you would like to input eg 'automation_object.first_screen.next_button.click'.

When you are done executing commands press control+c to exit the loop then press enter to quit.
