## Android Example

This example is to show how you can use AutomationObject framework to automate apps.  I also recommend you use their
GUI application to grab all the xPaths and layout your blueprints from their.

__Important__: You will need to start the Appium server on port 4723 which is the default port.  If you are unfamiliar
 with their node setup you can use their GUI application [here](http://appium.io/).
